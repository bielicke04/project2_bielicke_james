          <h1>Edward Gorey</h1>

          <p class="p-top">Edward St. John Gorey (February 22, 1925 – April 15, 2000) was an American writer and artist noted for his illustrated books. His characteristic pen-and-ink drawings often depict vaguely unsettling narrative scenes in Victorian and Edwardian settings. His books may be found in the humor and cartoon sections of major bookstores, but books such as "The Object Lesson" have earned serious critical respect as works of surrealist art. His experimentation—creating books that were wordless, books that were literally matchbox-sized, pop-up books, books entirely populated by inanimate objects—complicates matters still further. As Gorey told Lisa Solod of The Boston Globe, "Ideally, if anything were any good, it would be indescribable." Gorey classified his own work as literary nonsense, the genre made most famous by Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear.</p>

          <p>From 1953 to 1960, he lived in Manhattan and worked for the Art Department of Doubleday Anchor, illustrating book covers. His first independent work, "The Unstrung Harp", was published in 1953. He made a notable impact on the world of theater with his designs for the 1977 Broadway revival of "Dracula", for which he won the Tony Award for Best Costume Design and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Scenic Design. In 1980, Gorey became particularly well known for his animated introduction to the PBS series "Mystery!". In the introduction of each "Mystery!" episode, host Vincent Price would welcome viewers to "Gorey Mansion".</p>

          <p class="p-line">From 1995 to April 2000, the normally reclusive artist lived in Yarmouth Port, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod. After Gorey's death, his executors turned up a large cache of unpublished work complete and incomplete. Gorey's home was turned into the "Edward Gorey House Museum" where many of the unpublished work is shown. Finally, in response to being called gothic, Gorey stated, "If you're doing nonsense it has to be rather awful, because there'd be no point. I'm trying to think if there's sunny nonsense. Sunny, funny nonsense for children—oh, how boring, boring, boring. As Schubert said, "there is no happy music." – and, that's true – there really isn't. And, there's probably no happy nonsense, either."</p>
